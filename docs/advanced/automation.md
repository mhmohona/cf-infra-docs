# Automation & bots

Conda-forge has a large number of moving parts and its ecosystem is constantly evolving. To keep up with the pace of the project, we have developed a number of bots to automate the process of maintaining the feedstocks and the conda-forge ecosystem. These bots are the backbone of the conda-forge ecosystem and are responsible for a large number of the tasks that are required to keep the project running smoothly. In this section, we will discuss the different bots that are used in the conda-forge ecosystem and how they are used.

Before starting its important to outline the most important concepts in the conda-forge ecosystem. These concepts are used throughout the documentation and are important to understand the different bots.

## Core concepts

Below we have a general workflow diagram of the conda-forge ecosystem. It is a work in progress and we welcome any suggestions to improve it.
